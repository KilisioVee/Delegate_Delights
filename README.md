Delegate Delights: Showcasing the Power of Delegates in C#
 Delegates in ASP.NET Core are a fundamental part of the framework's event-driven programming model. Delegates are used to define and reference methods, allowing for decoupling and dynamic invocation of code. They provide a way to pass methods as parameters, store references to methods, and invoke methods asynchronously. Delegates play a crucial role in various aspects of ASP.NET Core, such as event handling, middleware pipeline, and dependency injection.
 In the context of ASP.NET Core, delegates are commonly used in the following scenarios:

 1.Event Handling: ASP.NET Core uses delegates to implement event-driven programming. Events such as request handling, authentication, and routing expose delegate-based event handlers that can be subscribed to and executed when the corresponding event occurs.

 2.Middleware Pipeline: In the ASP.NET Core request pipeline, delegates are used to define the middleware components that process incoming requests and outgoing responses. Each middleware component is a delegate that takes a HttpContext object as a parameter and returns a Task. These delegates are chained together to form the middleware pipeline, where each delegate can choose to pass the request to the next delegate or short-circuit the pipeline.

 3.Dependency Injection: Delegates can also be used in ASP.NET Core's dependency injection (DI) container to specify the implementation of a service. When registering services in the DI container, you can use delegates to specify factory methods that create instances of the service. This allows for dynamic creation of service instances based on the requested context.
